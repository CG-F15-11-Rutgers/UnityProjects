###B2: Inverse Kinematics and Behavior Tree

Characters – Street fighters, Soldier

User Input – Keyboard(Arrow Keys, Shift, E for door open)

Object Interaction – Door

Story is situated in a complex environment where we have a ground with a warehouse and door in it.

Initially Street fighters are approaching each other and then they look at each other and after that some dispute happens between them so they start fighting with each other. We have one surveillance camera (top right corner) to view the streets. As we see fights on street, we can move our soldier in that direction (User Interaction). As the fighters get to know about the soldier approaching them, they start running away from each other.

While wandering in the streets for fighters, our soldier come across the warehouse. Where he can open the door to look into for the fighters. (Object Interaction).
User Interaction – Our soldier can run fast to accelerate the search by pressing shift key while wandering.
Object Interaction – Our soldier can interact with the door and open the door by pressing E key.

We used inverse kinematics for two different actions namely

Look-at Action
Random Fight Action
Scalable to Agents – Our street fighters and soldier is prefab and all the street fighters uses common scripts. So, It is quite scalable if we plan to add more fighters or soldiers. We have 7 characters: 6 Street fighters and 1 Soldier.

Non Linear characteristic – Our fighters chooses different fight moves randomly.
